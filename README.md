## Intallation using Docker

Docker images are available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/42henrik/roon-extension-yamaha) and the stable image can be pulled by:
``docker pull 42henrik/roon-extension-yamaha:stable``

Start the docker by running:

```
docker run -d \
  --name your-roon-extension-yamaha-name \
  --volume /<local_folder>/<path>/roon-extension-yamaha:app\
  --env ID="MyID" \
  --network=host \
  --restart=always \
  42henrik/roon-extension-yamaha:stable 
```

Following docker options are optional:
| Option | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| --env ID="MyID" | Adds an identification tag shown in the Roon extension settings. It allows you to distinguish the extensions in case you run several instances |
| --volume | Path to the local folder on host where files, dependent modules and Roon config.json file will be stored. |

## Tested devices

The extension has been tested on a Yamaha RX-A3070, but a broader support of Yamaha receivers are expected.

The roon-extension-yamaha is built on **Yamaha Extended Control (YXC) API Specification (Basic)**, rev 1.x, published 2016, hence the extension should possibly work with receivers manufactured 2016 and later.

## Known limitation

The extension will search for Yamaha receivers on your network at the first launch and it will present the first one that appear. If there are several receivers connected to the network you should bring them up one by one. After it has identified the receiver it saves its IP address. To avoid network scans for receivers; you could either configure the receiver with a static adress *or* register your receivers' MAC adress in your DHCP server/router.
